    Parameters
    ----------
        filename : str
            Input filename
        species : dict
            Dictionary using the names as keys. If you have a list of
            species, use pmutt.pmutt_list_to_dict to make a dict.
        species_delimiter : str, optional
            Delimiter that separate species. Leading and trailing spaces
            will be trimmed. Default is '.'
        reaction_delimiter : str, optional
            Delimiter that separate states of the reaction. Leading and
            trailing spaces will be trimmed. Default is '>>'
        raise_error : bool, optional
            If True, raises an error if the transition state is not located in
            species. Default is True
        raise_warning : bool, optional
            Only relevant if raise_error is False. Raises a warning if the
            transition state is not located in species. Default is True
